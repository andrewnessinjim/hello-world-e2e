# End to End Hello World

A hello world app that does what all hello word apps have been traditionally doing: display a static hello world. You can view the app deployed [here](https://hello-world-e2e.herokuapp.com/). The page also shows the tools used in displaying just hello world:

* User interface written in **ReactJS** and **Sass**
* Server written with **Typescript** and executed in **NodeJS**
* Static web content served with **Express**
* Dynamic content served with **Apollo** server that is based on **GraphQL**
* Persistent data stored in **MongoDB**
* Unit test cases written using **Jest**
* End to end test cases written using **Cypress**
* Dependencies managed by **npm**
* CI/CI pipeline implemented in **CircleCI**
* Application deployed in **Heroku**
* **Pug** used minimally to bootstrap the app
* Source code maintained using **Git** and **GitHub**
* Application packaged in **Docker**
* **Gulp**, **Webpack** and **Babel** to automate development and build process.
* **Visual Studio Code** IDE (project includes configurations to make debugging in vscode easier)

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate all these tools working together that can be used as a template for apps based on the same tools.

## Motivation
I put this together because I found the existing zero-config-solutions too abstract. I wanted more control over the tools without losing the benefits of end to end automation. After taking the courses listed below, I felt more comfortable configuring the tools separately and making them work together.
